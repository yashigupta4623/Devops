| IP Address     | Unique identifier of a device on a network (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)                       |
|   DNS          | Converts domain names to IP addresses (e.g., `google.com` → `142.250.183.206`)         |
|   HTTP         | Hypertext Transfer Protocol — sends/receives data over web (port 80)                   |
|   HTTPS        | Secure HTTP using SSL/TLS encryption (port 443)                                        |
|   Ports        | Virtual endpoints to communicate with services (e.g., port 22 for SSH, 3306 for MySQL) |
|   Firewall     | Controls network traffic based on predefined security rules                            |
|    NAT         | Network Address Translation — helps map private IPs to public IPs                      |
|   Subnet       | A logical division of IP networks                                                      |

FIREWALL is like a security guard for your computer or network. It controls what data can come in or go out by allowing or blocking network traffic based on rules.

Firewall rules can be based on :
- IP Address
- Domain Names
- Protocols
- Programs
- Ports
- keywords

Types :
1. NETWORK BASED FW : Combination of H/W n S/W; protects an entire network.
2. HOST BASED FW : S/W fw installed on compt;protect the computer only; third party host based firewall; eg : Zone Alarm

- FIREWALL CONTROL(using ufw)

sudo ufw status              # View current status
sudo ufw allow 22            # Allow SSH
sudo ufw allow 80            # Allow HTTP
sudo ufw deny 23             # Block Telnet
sudo ufw enable              # Turn firewall ON
